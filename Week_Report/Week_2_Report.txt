Week 2 – Dataset Preparation & Image Preprocessing

Project:** Sign Language Detection Using OpenCV

Course: CAP6415 – Fall 2025

---

1. Overview

During Week 2, the main focus was on **dataset preparation** and **developing the preprocessing pipeline** for hand-gesture images. A new Jupyter Notebook titled **Data_Preprocessing.ipynb** was created to automate reading raw images, applying OpenCV transformations, and saving cleaned, standardized samples.

This work establishes the foundation for the CNN model training scheduled for Week 3.

---

2. Dataset Preparation

A folder structure was created locally to organize gesture images into alphabet-labeled directories:

```
dataset/
│── A/
│── B/
│── C/
│── …
│── Z/
```

Each folder contains raw hand-images captured using a webcam.
For Week 2, the dataset includes **10–15 images per class** (≈300–400 images total).

This will be expanded next week.

3. Preprocessing Pipeline (Implemented in Notebook)

The notebook contains a complete, functional data-processing pipeline, applied to each image:

Step-by-step transformations

Load image
Convert to grayscale:- using `cv2.cvtColor()`
Apply Gaussian blur:- to remove noise (`cv2.GaussianBlur()`)
Otsu thresholding:- for hand segmentation (`cv2.threshold()`)
Resize to 64×64 pixels:- for CNN input
Save preprocessed image inside:

```
processed_dataset/
│── A/
│── B/
│── C/
│── …
│── Z/
```

The entire pipeline is fully automated and processes every subfolder inside `dataset/`.

---

4. Visualization Output**

The notebook includes a visualization cell that:

Displays one **original image**
Displays the **corresponding processed image**

using matplotlib:

```
Original Image  |  Processed (Grayscale + Threshold) Image
```

This serves as verification that segmentation and preprocessing work correctly.

---

5. Results

Total images processed: (output shown directly in notebook)
All processed images were saved successfully in `processed_dataset/`.
The preprocessing quality is consistent across gesture classes.
Thresholding created a clean binary silhouette of the hand suitable for CNN analysis.
